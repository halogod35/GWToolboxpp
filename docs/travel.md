# Travel Window

The Travel window allows you to quickly travel to any outpost in the game that you have unlocked.

## Main Features
- **Outpost Selection**: Choose from a dropdown menu of all available outposts.
- **Quick Travel Buttons**: Instantly travel to commonly visited outposts.
- **District Selection**: Choose which district to travel to.
- **Favorites**: Set and use your favorite outposts for quick access.

## Usage
1. Open the Travel window.
2. Select an outpost from the dropdown menu or use one of the quick travel buttons.
3. Choose a district if desired.
4. Click to travel to the selected outpost.

## Favorites
- Add outposts to your favorites list for easy access.
- Click the "Add" button to add a new favorite.
- Edit or remove favorites as needed.

## Chat Commands
Use `/tp`, `/to`, or `/travel` followed by the outpost name or abbreviation to quickly travel. For example:
- `/tp doa` for Domain of Anguish
- `/tp embark` for Embark Beach
- `/tp gh` to enter or leave your guild hall

You can use various shortcuts and partial names for outposts and districts. Some examples include:
- `kama ae1` - Kamadan, American district 1
- `fa l` - Fort Aspenwood (Luxon)
- `deep ee` - The Deep, Europe English district

## Additional Features
- Automatically retry if a district is full (can be toggled in settings).
- Option to close or collapse the window after traveling.
- Special handling for elite areas like The Deep and Urgoz's Warren.
- In pre-Searing Ascalon, only the 5 pre-Searing outposts are available.

## Settings
- **Close on travel**: Automatically close the Travel window after selecting a destination.
- **Collapse on travel**: Automatically collapse the Travel window after selecting a destination.
- **Automatically retry if the district is full**: Keep trying to enter a full district.
