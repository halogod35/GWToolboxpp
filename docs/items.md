# Item Management Features

GWToolbox++ provides several advanced item management features to enhance your gameplay experience. These features are designed to streamline inventory management, improve item filtering, and provide convenient shortcuts for common item-related tasks.

## Inventory Manager

The Inventory Manager module offers the following functionality:

- **Ctrl+Click Actions**: Quickly move items between your inventory and storage by holding Ctrl and clicking on an item.
- **Right-Click Context Menu**: Access additional options for items by right-clicking them in your inventory or storage.
- **Auto-Identify**: Automatically identify all unidentified items of a specific rarity (e.g., all blue items).
- **Auto-Salvage**: Automatically salvage all salvageable items of a specific rarity.
- **Bulk Item Movement**: Easily move all items of a certain type (e.g., all materials, all tomes) between inventory and storage.
- **Stack Splitting**: Quickly split stacks of items when moving them.
- **Trade Improvements**: Automatically offer full stacks of items when trading.

## Item Filter

The Item Filter module allows you to customize which item drops are visible in the game world:

- **Rarity-based Filtering**: Hide or show drops based on item rarity (white, blue, purple, gold, green).
- **Separate Filters**: Set different filters for items you can pick up and items reserved for party members.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Define specific items that should never be hidden, regardless of rarity.

## Settings

Both the Inventory Manager and Item Filter have customizable settings:

- **Salvage Options**: Choose which bags to salvage from, whether to salvage rare materials or Nicholas items.
- **Merchant Window Options**: Hide certain items from the merchant sell window.
- **Filter Customization**: Fine-tune which items are hidden or shown based on rarity and ownership.

These features combine to provide a powerful suite of tools for managing your items more efficiently in Guild Wars.
