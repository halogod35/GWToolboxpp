# Input Modules

GWToolbox++ includes several modules that enhance and fix various input-related aspects of Guild Wars. These modules improve the user experience by addressing common issues and adding useful features.

## Mouse Fix

The Mouse Fix module addresses issues related to cursor movement and camera control in Guild Wars.

### Features:
- Fixes camera glitches when moving the mouse
- Allows customization of the cursor size
- Improves overall mouse responsiveness

### Settings:
- Enable cursor fix: Toggles the mouse fix functionality
- Guild Wars cursor size: Allows you to adjust the size of the in-game cursor (16-64 pixels)

Note: Cursor sizes other than 32 pixels might cause the cursor to disappear randomly. If this happens, right-click to make the cursor reappear.

## Mouse Walking Module

The Mouse Walking Module provides a quick way to toggle mouse walking on and off using a keyboard shortcut.

### Features:
- Quickly enable or disable mouse walking by holding the Left Alt key
- Automatically restores the previous mouse walking state when the key is released

This module is particularly useful for players who frequently switch between mouse walking and normal movement modes.

## Keyboard Language Fix

The Keyboard Language Fix module ensures that Guild Wars uses the correct keyboard layout, particularly for non-English keyboards.

### Features:
- Attempts to set the correct keyboard layout before Guild Wars loads its own settings
- Prioritizes the en-US (English US) keyboard layout if available
- Falls back to the current system keyboard layout if en-US is not found

This module is especially helpful for players using non-English keyboard layouts, as it helps prevent input issues caused by mismatched keyboard settings.

These input modules work together to provide a smoother, more customizable input experience in Guild Wars, addressing common pain points and adding quality-of-life improvements for players.
