# GWToolbox++ Plugins

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING ⚠️

**Plugins are NOT officially supported by GWToolbox++ developers and may be unsafe. Use plugins at your own risk and only if you fully trust the author.**

**Using plugins is NOT permitted by ArenaNet and may violate the Guild Wars Terms of Service. Using plugins could result in account suspension or banning.**

## What are Plugins?

Plugins are additional features or modifications that can be added to GWToolbox++. They are created by third-party developers and are not part of the official GWToolbox++ package.

## Using Plugins

If you choose to use plugins despite the risks, here's how to add them to GWToolbox++:

1. Place the plugin DLL file in the `plugins` folder of GWToolbox++.
2. Restart GWToolbox++ or use the "Refresh" button in the Plugins settings.
3. Enable the plugin through the GWToolbox++ interface.

## Plugin Settings

Some plugins may have their own settings. These can usually be accessed through the GWToolbox++ settings interface.

## Visibility Control

You can show or hide a plugin's UI through the GWToolbox++ interface, typically by toggling a checkbox next to the plugin's name.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using plugins:

1. Disable all plugins and see if the issue persists.
2. If the issue is resolved, re-enable plugins one by one to identify the problematic one.
3. Report the issue to the plugin developer, not to GWToolbox++ developers.

Remember, GWToolbox++ developers do not provide support for third-party plugins. If you encounter any bugs or issues while using plugins, do not report them to the GWToolbox++ team.

## Final Reminder

By using plugins, you acknowledge that you're doing so at your own risk. GWToolbox++ developers are not responsible for any consequences resulting from the use of third-party plugins.
