# Materials Window
The Materials window allows you to automatically buy and sell rare and common materials from the traders. It also provides price checks and purchase options for crafting materials needed for consets, powerstones, and resurrection scrolls.

## Features
- Buy and sell common and rare materials
- Price check and purchase materials for crafting consets, powerstones, and resurrection scrolls
- Automatically manage gold for transactions
- Use existing stock in inventory and storage when buying materials

## Usage
1. Stand next to a material trader.
2. Enter the quantity of materials you want to buy or sell.
3. Click "Price Check" to get current prices, or "Buy" to purchase immediately.
4. For selling, click "Sell" instead of "Buy".

The window displays real-time progress of your transactions and updates prices as they change.

### Crafting Materials
For consets, powerstones, and resurrection scrolls, the window shows the total price for the materials needed. You can adjust the quantity and purchase all required materials at once.

### Queue System
- Multiple orders are queued and processed in order.
- Sell orders take priority over buy orders.
- Price checks have the highest priority.

### Gold Management
Enable "Automatically manage gold" in the [Settings](settings) window to have GWToolbox++ automatically withdraw or deposit gold as needed during transactions.

### Using Existing Stock
Enable "Use stock" to take into account materials you already have in your inventory and storage when buying materials.

## Controls
- **Cancel**: Cancels all queued orders.
- **Progress Bar**: Shows the progress of the current set of transactions.

## Known Issues
- The trader might continue or stop working unexpectedly when moving away from the NPC. If this happens, try moving back to the NPC, re-zoning, or changing districts.
- When selling common materials, ensure your inventory stacks are in multiples of 10 to avoid transaction failures.
