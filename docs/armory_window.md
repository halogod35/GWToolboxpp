# Armory Window

The Armory Window is a powerful feature that allows you to preview all armor in the game in all colors on your character. This tool is perfect for planning your character's appearance or simply exploring the vast array of armor options available in Guild Wars.

## Features

- **Preview All Armor**: Browse through every armor set available in the game for your character's profession.
- **Color Customization**: Apply any dye color to each armor piece to see how it looks.
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are applied to your character in real-time, allowing you to see exactly how the armor will look in-game.
- **Campaign Filter**: Filter armor sets by campaign (Core, Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall, Eye of the North).
- **Costume Preview**: Preview full costumes and festival hats.

## How to Use

1. Open the Armory Window from the GWToolbox++ menu.
2. Select the armor slot you want to change (Head, Chest, Hands, Legs, Feet).
3. Browse through the available armor pieces for that slot.
4. Click on an armor piece to apply it to your character.
5. Use the color pickers to change the dye colors for each part of the armor piece.
6. Use the campaign filter to narrow down the armor options if desired.

## Notes

- The Armory Window only changes the appearance of your character locally. Other players will still see your actual equipped armor.
- Some special armors or costumes may not be available for preview.
- Weapon previews are currently not supported.

Remember to click the "Reset" button if you want to revert all changes and return to your originally equipped armor.

Enjoy experimenting with different armor combinations and colors to create your perfect look!
