# Duping Window

The Duping Window is a feature in GWToolbox++ that helps players monitor and track enemy duplication (duping) in the Domain of Anguish (DoA) area. This window is particularly useful for players engaging in DoA runs, as it provides real-time information about enemy duping status.

## Features

1. **Enemy Type Tracking**: The window tracks three types of enemies:
   - Souls (Soul Tormentors)
   - Waters (Water Tormentors)
   - Minds (Mind Tormentors)

2. **Enemy Counters**: Displays the total count of each enemy type within range.

3. **Health Bars**: Shows the current health of each tracked enemy.

4. **Duping Status**: Indicates when an enemy is duping (using the skill "Call to the Torment").

5. **Regen Pips**: Displays the health regeneration rate of each enemy.

6. **Last Duped Timer**: Shows how long ago each enemy last duped.

7. **Target Selection**: Allows you to target an enemy by clicking on their entry in the window.

## Settings

The Duping Window can be customized with the following settings:

- **Hide when there is nothing to show**: Automatically hides the window when there are no relevant enemies to display.
- **Range**: Adjust the range (in game units) within which enemies are tracked.
- **Enemy Counters**: Toggle the display of total counts for each enemy type.
- **Duping thresholds**: Set the health threshold below which enemy duping info is displayed for each enemy type.

## Usage

1. Enable the Duping Window in GWToolbox++ settings.
2. The window will automatically appear when you enter the Domain of Anguish.
3. Monitor the window to track enemy duping status and make tactical decisions based on the information provided.
4. Click on an enemy's entry to target them in-game.

This tool is especially useful for coordinating attacks and managing enemy duplication during DoA runs, helping players to optimize their strategies and improve clear times.
