# Hall of Monuments

The Hall of Monuments module in GWToolbox++ allows you to view and track your Hall of Monuments (HoM) achievements directly in-game. This feature provides easy access to your progress towards various HoM rewards in Guild Wars 2.

## Features

- View your current HoM achievements
- Track progress across all five monuments
- Display point totals for each monument and overall
- Open your HoM page in a web browser

## Usage

To access the Hall of Monuments window:
1. Open the GWToolbox++ main window
2. Click on the "Hall of Monuments" button

The window will display your current achievements across all five monuments:

1. Resilience (Armor)
2. Fellowship (Companions and Heroes)
3. Honor (Titles)
4. Valor (Weapons)
5. Devotion (Miniatures)

For each monument, you'll see:
- Total points earned
- Detailed breakdown of achievements
- Progress towards specific reward tiers

## Updating Your HoM Data

The module automatically fetches your HoM data from the official Guild Wars 2 HoM website. If your achievements have been updated recently, you may need to refresh the data:

1. Close the Hall of Monuments window
2. Re-open the window to fetch the latest data

## Opening Your HoM Page

To view your full Hall of Monuments page in a web browser:
1. Click the "Open in Browser" button at the bottom of the HoM window
2. Your default web browser will open, displaying your complete HoM page on the official Guild Wars 2 website

## Notes

- The HoM data is tied to your Guild Wars account, not individual characters
- Changes to your HoM in-game may take some time to reflect on the official website and in the GWToolbox++ module
- Make sure your Guild Wars account is properly linked to your Guild Wars 2 account for accurate tracking
