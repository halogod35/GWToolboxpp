# Reroll Window

The Reroll window allows you to quickly switch between characters on your account without logging out completely.

## Main Features
- **Character List**: Displays all characters on your account.
- **Quick Switch**: Click on a character name to switch to that character.
- **Travel Options**: Choose whether to travel to the same location after rerolling.
- **Party Options**: Choose whether to rejoin your party after rerolling.

## Usage
1. Open the Reroll window.
2. Click on the name of the character you want to switch to.
3. Confirm your choice if prompted (e.g., when in an explorable area).

## Settings
- **Travel to same location after rerolling**: If checked, you'll be moved to the same map after switching characters.
- **Re-join your party after rerolling**: If checked, you'll automatically rejoin your previous party after switching characters.
- **Return to original character on fail**: If checked, you'll switch back to your original character if the reroll process fails.

## Chat Commands
Use `/reroll` or `/rr` followed by a profession name or character name to quickly switch characters. For example:
- `/reroll warrior` to switch to your first available warrior character.
- `/reroll My Character Name` to switch to a specific character.

## Excluded Characters
You can set up a list of characters to exclude from the `/reroll` command. This is useful if you have characters you don't want to accidentally switch to.

## Notes
- The reroll process may take a few moments as it logs out your current character and logs in the new one.
- If you're in an explorable area, you'll be prompted to confirm before rerolling.
- The window will display all characters available on your account when you're at the character selection screen.
